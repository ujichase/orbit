    get - fetch an hdl unit for code integration

SYNOPSIS
    orbit get [options] <unit>

DESCRIPTION
    Returns hdl code snippets for the provided design unit to be integrated into
    the current design. The code snippets are returned in the native hdl
    language of the identified design unit. Code snippets are designed to be
    copy and pasted from the console to the current design for quick code 
    integration.
    
    If an ip is not provided with the '--ip' option, then it will search the local
    ip for the requested design unit.
    
    If the design unit is in VHDL with the '--instance' option being used without
    the '--component' option, then it will return the direct instantiation code
    style (VHDL-93 feature).
    
    Copying unit instantiations into higher-level entities will not 
    automatically track source code references across ips. In order to properly
    establish source code reference tracking across ips, the local ip's manifest
    must have an up to date '[dependencies]' table that lists all the ips from
    which it references source code.
    
    An identifier prefix or suffix can be attached to the signal declarations and
    the instantiation's port connection signals by using '--signal-prefix' and 
    '--signal-suffix' respectively. These optional texts are treated as normal
    strings and are not checked for correct hdl coding syntax.
    
    When no output options are specified, this command by default will display
    the unit's declaration.
    
    A design unit must visible in order for it to return the respective code
    snippets. When fetching a design unit that exists within the local ip, it
    can be any visibility. When fetching a design unit that exists outside of the
    local ip, its visibility must be "public". Design units that are set to 
    "protected" or "private" visibility are not allowed to be referenced across
    ips.
    
    Exporting the unit's declaration information can be accomplished by using the
    '--json' option. The valid json is unformatted for encouragement to be 
    processed by other programs.
    
    By default, the code snippets will be displayed in the design unit's native
    hardware description language. To return the code snippets in a particular
    language, use the '--lang' option. Valid values are "vhdl", "sv", or "native".

OPTIONS
    <unit>
        Primary design unit identifier

    --ip <spec>
        Ip specification

    --json
        Export the unit's information as valid json

    --library, -l
        Display the unit's library declaration

    --component, -c
        Display the unit's declaration

    --signals, -s
        Display the constant and signal declarations

    --instance, -i
        Display the unit's instantiation

    --language <hdl>
        Display in the specified language (vhdl, sv, native)

    --architecture, -a
        Display the unit's architectures

    --name <identifier>
        Set the instance's identifier

    --signal-prefix <str>
        Prepend information to the instance's signals

    --signal-suffix <str>
        Append information to the instance's signals
